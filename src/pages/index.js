            I’m originally from Singapore and have grown up in and lived in
            seven different countries! I moved to NYC in July 2019 to pursue my
            MSc in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University. I’m passionate
            about sustainability, design, technology, and user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading essay collections, discovering new
            magazines, teaching myself embroidery, listening to podcasts about
            fashion and design, and taking long walks around the city.
